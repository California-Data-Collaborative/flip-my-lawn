# Flip My Lawn
Check out the live site: [FlipMyLawn.com](www.flipmylawn.com).

Here in California, we can save water and money by converting our lawns to California native landscapes. Flip My Lawn was built to provide simple, easy-to-access estimates of these savings for all Californians. Please remember that these are only estimates and may be optimistic. Current imagery is from 2016. For more details about our approach, please take a look at our [methodology](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10KD-uFsSv4Bu6RVPKvaiU_0P4ZvcW5R25bFYTtHzuAo/edit?usp=sharing).

Flip My Lawn is a joint effort of the California Data Collaborative and the University of California, Los Angeles. It is funded by an [Innovative Conservation Program](http://www.bewaterwise.com/innovative-conservation-program.html) grant and built by [ARGO](http://www.argolabs.org/).
